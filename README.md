### What are we gonna study?

Our boss ask us to find a new location for our company. The company is running well so we want to move to United States. We have decided to choose three cities: San Francisco, Los Angeles and New York. 

Here you will find three notebooks, each one for each city in which we will limit the distance from our location chose. From this location, we will study how many requirements asked will be satisfy through a countplot. 

In the last notebook, "Conclusions", we will decide in which city we will establish, depending on the requirements satisfied and the distance given.
